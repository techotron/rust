// You can print numbers in base 2 (binary), base 8 (octal), base 10 (decimal), and base 16 (hexadecimal) with the below notation:

fn main() {
    let three = 0b11;
    let thirty = 0o36;
    let three_hundred = 0x12C;

    println!("base 10: {} {} {}", three, thirty, three_hundred);
    println!("base 2: {:b} {:b} {:b}", three, thirty, three_hundred);
    println!("base 8: {:o} {:o} {:o}", three, thirty, three_hundred);
    println!("base 16: {:x} {:x} {:x}", three, thirty, three_hundred);
}
